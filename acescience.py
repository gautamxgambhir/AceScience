            "  - 100% of the questions should be True/False or Yes/No type. "

            "- make the questions a bit tricky, and tough to answer too"
            "- Ensure the false statements are realistic and plausible to challenge the user. For example: "
            "  - Text: 'The heart has four chambers.' "

            "- For the questions, ensure scientifically accurate. questions. "
            "- Use only the provided text for generating questions but allow slight modifications to create false statements. "
            "- Avoid asking questions that require users to reference the provided text directly. "
            "- Ensure that the questions are meaningful, scientifically accurate, and exam-relevant. "

            "- Modify the provided text slightly to create challenging false statements while maintaining scientific accuracy. "
            "- Avoid generating questions where the text provided is required to answer the question. "
            "- The explanation should be 1-2 sentences and clarify the reasoning behind the answer. "
