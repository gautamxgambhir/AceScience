This description of a\nchemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a\nshorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a\nword-equation.\nThe word-equation for the above reaction would be –\nMagnesium + Oxygen →Magnesium oxide (1.1)\n            (Reactants) (Product)\nThe substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),\nmagnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is\nmagnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.\nA word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an\narrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand\nside (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are\nwritten on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.\nThe arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of\nthe reaction.You must have observed that magnesium ribbon bur ns with a\ndazzling white flame and changes into a white powder . This powder is\nmagnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium\nand oxygen present in the air .\n2024-25"

                "text": "Chemical Reactions and Equations 31.1.1 W riting a Chemical Equation\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?\nChemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –\nMg + O2  →  MgO (1.2)\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the\nsame on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the bur ning of magnesium in air .\n1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\nIn other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.\nThe word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –\nZinc + Sulphuric acid  →  Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen\nThe above word-equation may be represented by the following\nchemical equation –\nZn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2(1.3)\nLet us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both\nsides of the arrow.\nElement Number of atoms in Number of atoms\nreactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\nZn 1 1\nH 2 2\nS 1 1\nO 4 4\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.\nLet us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2(1.4)\n2024-25"

The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),\nrespectively.

(1.9) becomes\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g)  → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g) (1.10)\nNote that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this\nreaction water is used in the form of steam.\nUsually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless\nit is necessary to specify them.\nSometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,\ncatalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow\nin the equation.

This process\nis commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get\ntarnished in this manner . Have you noticed the colour of the coating\nformed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances\naround it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this\nprocess is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green\ncoating on copper are other examples of corrosion.\nCorrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships\nand to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of\niron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is\nspent to r eplace damaged ir on.

Usually substances which prevent oxidation\n(antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food\nin air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation.

It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater . You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.\nIn this Chapter , we will study the r eactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life.\nDo Y ou Know?Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator . When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea , Petunia  and Geranium , which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\nsolution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.\n2024-25"

W e have also lear nt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator , which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘ potenz ’ in German,\nmeaning power . On the pH scale we can measur e pH generally fr om\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. V alues less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6).

To get rid of this pain, people use bases called\nantacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the\nbeginning of this Chapter . These antacids neutralise the excess acid.\nMagnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for\nthis purpose.\npH change as the cause of tooth decay\nTooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth\nenamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium\nphosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in\nwater , but is corr oded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria\npresent in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food\nparticles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent\nthis is to clean the mouth after eating food.

Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances.\nSodium hydroxide\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor -alkali pr ocess because of the pr oducts for med–\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.\n2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.\nSodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode.

Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.\nAt ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide.

This is because oxygen is a very\nreactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\nThus on th e basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\nfollowing three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\nof medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity.

These ar e usually pr esent as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the pr esence of excess air . This pr ocess is known as r oasting. The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This pr ocess is known as calcination. The chemical r eaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows –\nRoasting\n2ZnS(s) + 3O (g) 2ZnO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2Heat →  \nCalcination\nZnCO (s) ZnO(s) + CO (g)3 2Heat →  \nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon.

They cannot\nbe obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,\ncarbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,\naluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals\nhave more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained\nby electrolytic reduction.

It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,\n22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is\nalloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver .\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an\namalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and\nzinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are\nnot good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making\nelectrical cir cuits. Solder , an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wir es together .\n3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.\nGalvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desir ed pr operties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.\nThe substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal.

Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.\nAt ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The\nprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\nin the flame of the bur ner. Copper does not bur n, but the hot metal is\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures.Do Y ou Know?Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium\ndevelops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air . This aluminium oxide coat makes it\nresistant to further corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the\noxide layer thicker .  During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode\nand is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode\nreacts with aluminium to make a thicker pr otective oxide layer .  This oxide layer can\nbe dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of\nmagnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.\nBut burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of\nzinc, iron, copper or lead.

These compounds are generally brittle and\nbreak into pieces when pressure is applied.\n(ii)Melting and Boiling points : Ionic compounds have high melting\nand boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable\namount of ener gy is r equir ed to br eak the str ong inter -ionic\nattraction.\n(iii) Solubility : Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in\nwater and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.\n(iv)Conduction of Electricity : The conduction of electricity through\na solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution\nof an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the\nopposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the\nsolution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct\nelectricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible\ndue to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct\nelectricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state\nsince the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely\ncharged ions are overcome due to the heat.

Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as\ntheir sulphide or oxide ores.

Y ou will find that\nthe ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very\nreactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\nThus on th e basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\nfollowing three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\nof medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity.

These ar e usually pr esent as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the pr esence of excess air . This pr ocess is known as r oasting. The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This pr ocess is known as calcination. The chemical r eaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows –\nRoasting\n2ZnS(s) + 3O (g) 2ZnO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2Heat →  \nCalcination\nZnCO (s) ZnO(s) + CO (g)3 2Heat →  \nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon.

They cannot\nbe obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,\ncarbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,\naluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals\nhave more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained\nby electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium\nare obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals\nare deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,\nchlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode).

It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,\n22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is\nalloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver .\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an\namalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals.

Solder , an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wir es together .\n3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.\nGalvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desir ed pr operties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.\nThe substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,\ndissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled\nto room temperature.\nIron pillar at DelhiThe wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy\nThe iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more\nthan 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India.

If we see a dog running, or a cow chewing cud, or a man\nshouting loudly on the street, we know that these are living beings. What\nif the dog or the cow or the man wer\ne asleep? W e would still think that\nthey wer e alive, but how did we know that? W e see them br eathing, and\nwe know that they are alive. What about plants? How do we know that\nthey ar e alive? W e see them gr een, some of us will say. But what about\nplants that have leaves of colours other than green? They grow over\ntime, so we know that they are alive, some will say. In other words, we\ntend to think of some sort of movement, either growth-related or not, as\ncommon evidence for being alive. But a plant that is not visibly growing is\nstill alive, and some animals can breathe without visible movement. So\nusing visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough.\nMovements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye –\nmovements of molecules, for example. Is this invisible molecular\nmovement necessary for life? If we ask this question to professional\nbiologists, they will say yes. In fact, viruses do not show any molecular\nmovement in them (until they infect some cell), and that is partly why\nthere is a controversy about whether they are truly alive or not.\nWhy ar e molecular movements needed for life? W e have seen in earlier\nclasses that living organisms are well-organised structures; they can\nhave tissues, tissues have cells, cells have smaller components in them,\nand so on. Because of the effects of the environment, this organised,\nordered nature of living structures is very likely to keep breaking down\nover time. If order breaks down, the organism will no longer be alive. So\nliving creatures must keep repairing and maintaining their structures.\nSince all these structures are made up of molecules, they must move\nmolecules around all the time.\nWhat are the maintenance processes in living organisms?\nLet us explore.\n5.1 WHA 5.1 WHA5.1 WHA 5.1 WHA5.1 WHA T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?T ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nThe maintenance functions of living organisms must go on even when\nthey ar e not doing anything particular .

This energy comes from\noutside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process\nto transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism,\nwhich we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call nutrition.\nIf the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will\nalso be needed from outside. Since life on earth depends on carbon-\nbased molecules, most of these food sources are also carbon-based.\nDepending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different\norganisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes.\nThe outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the\nenvironment is not under the control of the individual organism. These\nsources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the\nbody, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that\ncan be used for the various molecular movements needed for\nmaintaining living str uctures, as well as to the kind of molecules the\nbody needs to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the\nbody \nare necessary. Oxidising-reducing reactions are some of the most\ncommon chemical means to break -down molecules. For this, many\norganisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body. The process\nof acquiring oxygen from outside the body, and to use it  in the process\nof break -down of food sources for cellular needs, is what we call\nrespiration.\nIn the case of a single-celled organism, no specific organs for taking\nin food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because\nthe entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment.\nBut what happens when the body size of the organism increases and\nthe body design becomes more complex? In multi-cellular organisms,\nall the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding\nenvironment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of\nall the cells.\nWe have seen pr eviously how, in multi-cellular or ganisms, various\nbody parts have specialised in the functions they per form. We are familiar\nwith the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in\nthe body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake\nof food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues.\nHowever , this poses a pr oblem, since the food and oxygen ar e now taken\nup at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body\nneed them. This situation creates a need for a transportation system for\ncarrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body.\nWhen chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for\nenergy generation,  they create by-products that are not only useless\nfor the cells of the body, but could even be harmful. These waste by-\nproducts are  therefore needed to be removed from the body and discarded\noutside  by a process called excretion. Again, if the basic rules for body\n2024-25"

W e also need materials fr om outside in or der\nto grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in\nthe body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat.\nHow do living things get their food?\nThe general requirement for energy and materials is common in all\norganisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple\nfood material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon\ndioxide and water . These or ganisms, the autotr ophs, include gr\neen\nplants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances.\nThese complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones\nbefore they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To\nachieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the\nheterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs.\nHeterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.\n5.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition\nCarbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are\nfulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take\nin substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of\nenergy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water\nwhich is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and\nchlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.\nWe will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates\nwhich are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which\nserves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required\nby the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of\nthe energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form\nof glycogen.\n2024-25"

Since\nlarge amounts of water can also be lost\nthrough these stomata, the plant\ncloses these pores when it does not\nneed carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the\npore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water\nflows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open.

The form of nutrition\ndiffers depending on the type and availability of food material as well\nas how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food\nsource is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would\nallow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive\napparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by\nwhich the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms\nbreak- down the food material outside the body and then absorb it.\nExamples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others\ntake in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can\nbe taken in and broken down depends on the body design and\nfunctioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or\nanimals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used\nby a wide variety of or ganisms like cuscuta (amar -bel),  ticks, lice,\nleeches and tape-worms.\n5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?\nSince the food and the way it is obtained dif fer, the digestive system is\ndifferent in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food\nmay be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the\norganism increases, different parts become specialised to perform\ndifferent functions. For example, \nAmoeba takes in food using\ntemporary finger -like extensions of the cell sur face which fuse over\nthe food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 5.5). Inside the food-\nvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones\nwhich then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested\nmaterial is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In\nParamoecium , which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a\ndefinite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved\nto this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface\nof the cell.\n5.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings\nThe alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth\nto the anus. In Fig. 5.6, we can see that the tube has different parts.\nVarious r egions ar e specialised to per form dif ferent functions. What\nhappens to the food once it enters our body?

Naturally the food has to be processed to generate\nparticles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by\ncrushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the\nfood is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something\nwe like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water , but a fluid\ncalled saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food\nwe ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary\ncanal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the\nhelp of biological catalysts called\nenzymes. The saliva contains an\nenzyme called salivary amylase that\nbreaks down starch which is a complex\nmolecule to give simple sugar . The food\nis mixed thoroughly with saliva and\nmoved around the mouth while\nchewing by the muscular tongue.\nIt is necessary to move the food in\na regulated manner along the digestive\ntube so that it can be processed\nproperly in each part. The lining of\ncanal has muscles that contract\nrhythmically in order to push the food\nforward. These peristaltic movements\noccur all along the gut.\nFrom the mouth, the food is taken\nto the stomach through the food-pipe\nor oesophagus. The stomach is a large\norgan which expands when food\nenters it. The muscular walls of the\nstomach help in mixing the food\nthoroughly with more digestive juices.\nThe digestion in stomach is taken\ncare of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These\nrelease hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin,\nand mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which\nfacilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you\nthink is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the\nstomach fr om the action of the acid under nor mal conditions.

                "text": "Science 86have often heard adults complaining about ‘acidity’. Can this be related\nto what has been discussed above?\nThe exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle\nwhich releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the\nstomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part\nof the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of\nextensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various\nanimals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a\nlonger small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier\nto digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine.\nThe small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of\ncarbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act.\nBile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.\nFats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into\nsmaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar\nto the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in\nChapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains\nenzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down\nemulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which\nsecrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the\nproteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats\ninto fatty acids and glycerol.\nDigested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner\nlining of the small intestine has numer ous finger -like pr ojections called\nvilli which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly\nsupplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and\nevery cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building\nup new tissues and the repair of old tissues.\nThe unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall\nabsorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed\nfrom the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated\nby the anal sphincter .More to Know!Dental caries\nDental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins\nwhen bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel.\nMasses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental\nplaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers\nthe teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria\nproduce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing\ninflammation and infection.\n2024-25"

The\nfood material taken in during the process of nutrition is used in cells to\nprovide energy for various life processes. Diverse organisms do this in\ndifferent ways – some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely\ninto carbon dioxide and water , some use other pathways that do not\ninvolve oxygen (Fig. 5.8). In all cases, the first step is the break-down of\nglucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called\npyruvate. This pr ocess takes place in the cytoplasm. Further , the\npyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process\ntakes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes place\nin the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Break-\ndown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria.

Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen\nin our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is\ntaken. Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a\nthree-carbon molecule. This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during\nsudden activity causes cramps.\nFigure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8Figure 5.8  Break-down of glucose by various pathways\nThe energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used\nto synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other\nactivities in the cell.

Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide\nhas to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine\nand delicate. In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed\nwithin the body, so there have to be passages that will take air\nto this area. In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air\nin and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed.\nIn human beings (Fig. 5.9), air is taken into the body through\nthe nostrils. The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by\nfine hairs that line the passage. The passage is also lined with\nmucus which helps in this process.

Because\nboth oxygen and carbon dioxide have to\nbe transported by the blood, the heart\nhas different chambers to prevent the\noxygen-rich blood from mixing with the\nblood containing carbon dioxide. The\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach\nthe lungs for the carbon dioxide to be\nremoved, and the oxygenated blood from\nthe lungs has to be brought back to the\nheart. This oxygen-rich blood is then\npumped to the rest of the body.\nWe can follow this pr ocess step by\nstep (Fig. 5.11). Oxygen-rich blood from\nthe lungs comes to the thin-walled upper\nchamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes\nwhen it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber ,\nthe left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the\nmuscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to\nthe body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper\nchamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium\ncontracts, the corr esponding lower chamber , the right ventricle, dilates.\nThis transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the\nlungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various\norgans, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do.

Such separation\nallows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the\nbody. This is useful in animals that have high\nenergy needs, such as birds and mammals, which\nconstantly use energy to maintain their body\ntemperature. In animals that do not use energy\nfor this purpose, the body temperature depends\non the temperature in the environment. Such\nanimals, like amphibians or  many reptiles have\nthree-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing\nof the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood\nstreams. Fishes, on the other hand, have only two\nchambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped\nto the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly\nto the rest of the body.

The other kinds of raw materials needed for\nbuilding plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,\nthe soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,\nphosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances\ntherefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots.\nIf the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-\ncontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse\nto all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because\nof changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient\nto provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of\ntransportation is therefore essential in such situations.\nEnergy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not\nmove, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many\ntissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively\nslow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems\nhave to operate, however , can be very lar ge in plants such as very tall\ntrees.\nPlant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw\nmaterials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as\nindependently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem  moves water\nand minerals obtained from the soil. The other , phloem transports\nproducts of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised\nto other parts of the plant. W e have studied the structur e of these tissues\nin detail in Class IX.\nTransport of water\nIn xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are\ninterconnected to for m a continuous system of water -conducting\nchannels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact\nwith the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the\nconcentration of these ions between the r oot and the soil. W ater, therefore,\n2024-25"

In fact, evaporation of water molecules from\nthe cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water\nfrom the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the\nform of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is\nknown as transpiration.\nThus, transpiration helps in the absorption and\nupward movement of water and minerals dissolved\nin it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in\ntemperature regulation.  The effect of root pressure in\ntransport of water is more important at night. During\nthe day when the stomata are open, the transpiration\npull becomes the major driving force in the movement\nof water in the xylem.\nTransport of food and other substances\nSo far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants.\nNow let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly\nphotosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other\nparts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis\nis called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue\nknown as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem\ntransports amino acids and other substances. These substances are\nespecially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and\nto growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes\nplace in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both\nin upward and downward directions.\nUnlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple\nphysical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising\nFigure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12Figure 5.12\nMovement of water during transpiration in a tree\n2024-25"

Other metabolic activities\ngenerate nitrogenous materials which need to be removed. The biological\nprocess involved in the removal of these harmful metabolic wastes from\nthe body is called excretion. Different organisms use varied strategies to\ndo this. Many unicellular organisms remove these wastes by simple\ndiffusion from the body surface into the surrounding\nwater .

Urine\nproduced in the kidneys passes through the ureters\ninto the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is\nreleased through the urethra.\nHow is urine produced?

Each kidney has large numbers of these\nfiltration units called nephr ons packed close together .\nSome substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose,\namino acids, salts and a major amount of water , are\nselectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube.\nThe amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much\nexcess water there is in the body, and on how much of\ndissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming\nin each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ur eter,\nwhich connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder .\nUrine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure\nof the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out\nthrough the ur ethra. The bladder is muscular , so it is\nunder nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere.\nAs a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.\nMore to Know!Artificial kidney (Hemodialysis)\nKidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted\nblood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of\npoisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney\nfailure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove\nnitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis.\nArtificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended\nin a tank filled with dialysing fluid.\nThis fluid has the same osmotic\npressure as blood, except that it is\ndevoid of nitrogenous wastes. The\npatient’s blood is passed through\nthese tubes. During this passage,\nthe waste products from the blood\npass into dialysing fluid by diffusion.\nThe purified blood is pumped back\ninto the patient. This is similar to the\nfunction of the kidney, but it is\ndifferent since there is no re-\nabsorption involved. Normally, in a\nhealthy adult, the initial filtrate in the\nkidneys is about 180 L daily.\nHowever , the volume actually\nexcreted is only a litre or two a day,\nbecause the remaining filtrate is re-\nabsorbed in the kidney tubules.\nFigure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14Figure 5.14\nStructure of a nephron\n2024-25"

There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better . When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper ,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n6.1\n6.16.1 6.16.1ANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEMANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied  in Class IX.

How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear , the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\nThis information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)],  sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses fr om one part of the body to another .\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmi ssion.\nActivity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1Activity 6.1\n/square6Put some sugar in your mouth.

W e say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our r eactions. Y et these ar e situations wher e we ar e responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\nLet us consider this further . Take one of our examples. T\nouching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If\nnerve impulses ar e sent ar ound the way we have talked about earlier ,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.\nThinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.\nSimilarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt!\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other . Nerves fr om all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough.  In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought pr ocesses.  However , even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n2024-25"

Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body.  The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3).\nThey receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.\nWe also think about our actions. W riting, talking, moving a chair ,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next.  So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles.  This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles.  The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking.  As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.\nThe brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain.\nThe fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.  There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain.

The sensation of feeling full is because of a centre\nassociated with  hunger , which is in a separate part of the for e-brain.\nStudy the labelled diagram of the human brain. W e have seen that\nthe different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function\nof each part?\nLet us look at the other use of the word ‘reflex’ that we have talked\nabout in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like\nwithout our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it.\nIn fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them\neven if we wanted to.

If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\nSo far , we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?\nThe answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form.

So plants show two different\ntypes of movement – one dependent on growth and the other independent\nof growth.\n6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus\nLet us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive\nplant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves\nin response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle\ntissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move\nin response?\nFigure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4Figure 6.4  The sensitive plant\nIf we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part\nof the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a\npoint different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has\noccurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information.\nFinally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (Fig. 6.4).\n6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object.\nThis causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it.\nMore commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if\nthe plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the\nhelp of an example.\n2024-25"

So, in two\ndifferent kinds of phototropic movement, shoots\nrespond by bending towards light while roots\nrespond by bending away from it. How does this help\nthe plant?\nPlants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots\nof a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow\nupwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth\nof shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity\nis, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6). If ‘hydro’ means water and ‘chemo’\nrefers to chemicals, what would ‘hydrotropism’ and ‘chemotropism’\nmean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth\nmovements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes\ntowards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the\nreproductive processes of living organisms.\nLet us now once again think about how information is communicated\nin the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the\nsensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of\nsunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow.\nGrowth-r elated movement of plants will be even slower .\nEven in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to\ngrowth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly.\nSo controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to\nstimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly.\nFor this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly.Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2Activity 6.2\n/square6Fill a conical flask with water .\n/square6Cover the neck of the flask with a wire mesh.\n/square6Keep two or three freshly germinated bean\nseeds on the wire mesh.\n/square6Take a cardboard box which is open from one\nside.\n/square6Keep the flask in the box in such a manner\nthat the open side of the box faces light coming\nfrom a window (Fig. 6.5).\n/square6After two or three days, you will notice that\nthe shoots bend towards light and roots away\nfrom light.\n/square6Now turn the flask so that the shoots are away\nfrom light and the roots towards light.

Firstly, they will reach only\nthose cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell\nin the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in\na cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms\nbefore it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells\ncannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no\nwonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of\ncommunication between cells, namely, chemical communication.\nIf, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release\na chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the\noriginal cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound\nusing special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to\nrecognise infor mation, and even transmit it. This will be slower , of course,\nbut it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous\nconnections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These\ncompounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control\nand coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect.\nDifferent plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and\nresponses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from\nwhere they act and simply diffuse to the area of action.\nLet us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2].\nWhen growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised\nat the shoot tip, helps the cells to gr ow longer . When light is coming fr om\none side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot.\nThis concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the\nside of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to\nbend towards light.\nAnother example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like\nauxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,\nand it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in\nareas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples\nof plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need\nsignals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which\ninhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What are plant hormones?\n2. How is the movement of leaves of the sensitive plant different from the\nmovement of a shoot towards light?\n3. Give an example of a plant hormone that promotes growth.\n4. How do auxins promote the growth of a tendril around a support?\n5. Design an experiment to demonstrate hydrotropism.\n2024-25"

What do some animals, for instance squirrels,\nexperience when they are in a scary situation? Their bodies have to\nprepare for either fighting or running away. Both are very complicated\nactivities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many\ndifferent tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together\nin these actions. However , the two alter nate activities, fighting or running,\nare also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common\npreparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations\nshould ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How\nwould this be achieved?\nIf the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses\nvia nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming\nactivity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to\nbe sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-\nranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human\nbeings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the\nadrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands.\nAdrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different\nparts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it\nacts include the heart. As a r esult, the heart beats faster , resulting in\nsupply of more oxygen to our muscles. The blood to the digestive system\nand skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries\nin these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles. The\nbreathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the\ndiaphragm and the rib muscles. All these responses together enable the\nanimal body to be ready to deal with the situation. Such animal hormones\nare part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control\nand coordination in our body.\nActivity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3Activity 6.3\n/square6Look at Fig. 6.7.\n/square6Identify the endocrine glands mentioned in the figure.\n/square6Some of these glands have been listed in Table 6.1 and discussed\nin the text.

What functions do animal hormones perform? On the face of it,\nwe cannot imagine their r ole in dir ectional gr owth. W e have never seen\nan animal gr owing mor e in one dir ection or the other , depending on\nlight or gravity! But if we think about it a bit more, it will become evident\nthat, even in animal bodies, growth happens in carefully controlled places.\nPlants will grow leaves in many places on the plant body, for example.\nBut we do not grow fingers on our faces. The design of the body is carefully\nmaintained even during the growth of children.\n2024-25"

We have all seen salt packets which say ‘iodised\nsalt’ or ‘enriched with iodine’. Why is it important for us to have iodised\nsalt in our diet? Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make\nthyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat\nmetabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth.\nIodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient\nin our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One\nof the symptoms in this disease is a swollen neck.

                "text": "How do Organisms\nReproduce ?7 CHAPTER\nBefore we discuss the mechanisms by which organisms reproduce,\nlet us ask a more basic question – why do organisms reproduce?\nAfter all, reproduction is not necessary to maintain the life of an individual\norganism, unlike the essential life processes such as nutrition,\nrespiration, or excretion. On the other hand, if an individual organism is\ngoing to create more individuals, a lot of its energy will be spent in the\nprocess. So why should an individual organism waste energy on a process\nit does not need to stay alive? It would be interesting to discuss the\npossible answers in the classroom!\nWhatever the answer to this question, it is obvious that we notice\norganisms because they reproduce. If there were to be only one, non-\nreproducing member of a particular kind, it is doubtful that we would\nhave noticed its existence. It is the large numbers of organisms belonging\nto a single species that bring them to our notice. How do we know that\ntwo different individual organisms belong to the same species? Usually,\nwe say this because they look similar to each other . Thus, r eproducing\norganisms create new individuals that look very much like themselves.\n7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG7.1 DO ORG ANISMS CREAANISMS CREAANISMS CREAANISMS CREAANISMS CREA TE EXATE EXATE EXA\nTE EXATE EXA CT COPIES OFCT COPIES OFCT COPIES OFCT COPIES OFCT COPIES OF\nTHEMSEL THEMSELTHEMSEL THEMSELTHEMSEL VES? VES?VES? VES?VES?\nOrganisms look similar because their body designs are similar . If body\ndesigns are to be similar , the blueprints for these designs should be\nsimilar . Thus, repr oduction at its most basic level will involve making\ncopies of the blueprints of body design. In Class IX, we learnt that the\nchromosomes in the nucleus of a cell contain information for inheritance\nof features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information\nsource for making proteins. If the information is changed, different\nproteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered\nbody designs.\nTherefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA\ncopy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This\ncreates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, and they will need to\nbe separated fr om each other . However , keeping one copy of DNA in the\noriginal cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work,\n2024-25"

Therefore, DNA copying is\naccompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus, and\nthen the DNA copies separate, each with its own cellular apparatus.\nEffectively, a cell divides to give rise to two cells.\nThese two cells ar e of course similar , but ar e they likely to be\nabsolutely identical? The answer to this question will depend on how\naccurately the copying r eactions involved occur . No bio-chemical r eaction\nis absolutely reliable. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the process\nof copying the DNA will have some variations each time. As a result, the\nDNA copies generated will be similar , but may not be identical to the\noriginal. Some of these variations might be so drastic that the new DNA\ncopy cannot work with the cellular apparatus it inherits. Such a newborn\ncell will simply die. On the other hand, there could still be many other\nvariations in the DNA copies that would not lead to such a drastic\noutcome. Thus, the surviving cells are similar to, but subtly different\nfrom each other . This inbuilt tendency for variation during r eproduction\nis the basis for evolution, as we will discuss in the next chapter .\n7.1.1 The Impor tance of V ariation\nPopulations of organisms fill well-defined places, or niches, in the\necosystem, using their ability to reproduce. The consistency of DNA\ncopying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body\ndesign features that allow the organism to use that particular niche.\nReproduction is therefore linked to the stability of populations of species.\nHowever , niches can change because of r easons beyond the contr ol\nof the organisms. Temperatures on earth can go up or down, water levels\ncan vary, or there could be meteorite hits, to think of a few examples. If\na population of reproducing organisms were suited to a particular niche\nand if the niche were drastically altered, the population could be wiped\nout. However , if some variations wer e to be pr esent in a few individuals\nin these populations, there would be some chance for them to survive.\nThus, if there were a population of bacteria living in temperate waters,\nand if the water temperature were to be increased by global warming,\nmost of these bacteria would die, but the few variants resistant to heat\nwould survive and gr ow further . Variation is thus useful for the survival\nof species over time.\nQUESTIONS\n1. What is the importance of DNA copying in reproduction?\n2. Why is variation beneficial to the species but not necessarily\nfor the individual?\n2024-25"

The\nmodes by which various organisms reproduce depend on the body\ndesign of the organisms.\n7.2.1 Fission\nFor unicellular organisms, cell division, or fission, leads to the creation\nof new individuals. Many different patterns of fission have been observed.\nMany bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during\ncell division.

Spirogyra , for example,\nsimply breaks up into smaller pieces upon maturation. These pieces or\nfragments grow into new individuals. Can we work out the reason for\nthis, based on what we saw in Activity 7.4?\nThis is not true for all multi-cellular organisms. They cannot simply\ndivide cell-by-cell. The reason is that many multi-cellular organisms, as\nwe have seen, are not simply a random collection of cells. Specialised\ncells are organised as tissues, and tissues are organised into organs,\nwhich then have to be placed at definite positions in the body. In such a\ncarefully organised situation, cell-by-cell division would be impractical.\nMulti-cellular organisms, therefore, need to use more complex ways of\nreproduction.\nA basic strategy used in multi-cellular organisms is that different\ncell types perform different specialised functions. Following this general\npattern, reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific\ncell type. How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type, if\nthe organism itself consists of many cell types? The answer is that there\nmust be a single cell type in the organism that is capable of growing,\nproliferating and making other cell types under the right circumstances.\n7.2.3 Regeneration\nMany fully differentiated organisms have the ability to give rise to new\nindividual organisms from their body parts. That is, if the individual is\nsomehow cut or broken up into many pieces, many of these pieces grow\ninto separate individuals. For example, simple animals like Hydra  and\nPlanaria  can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows\ninto a complete organism. This is known as regeneration (see Fig. 7.3).\nRegeneration is carried out by specialised cells. These cells proliferate\nand make large numbers of cells. From this mass of cells, different cells\nundergo changes to become various cell types and tissues. These changes\n2024-25"

This\nproperty of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering\nor grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes for\nagricultural purposes. Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear\nflowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods\nalso make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange,\nrose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another\nadvantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are\ngenetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its\ncharacteristics.\n2024-25"

In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to\nproduce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode\nof reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of\nreproduction, which we have been discussing above?\n7.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction?\nThe creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as\nwell as of the cellular apparatus. The DNA copying mechanism, as we\nhave noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are\na source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual\norganism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population,\nvariations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would\ntherefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes\nthat allowed more and more variation to be generated.\nWhile DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they\nare precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow\nprocess. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many\nof the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular\napparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants\nbe speeded up? Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already\nhas variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two\ndifferent individuals in a population would have quite different patterns\nof accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living\nindividuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects.\nCombining variations from two or more individuals would thus create\nnew combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since\nit would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of\n2024-25"

If each new generation is to be the\ncombination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then\neach new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that\nthe previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the\ncellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for\nsolving this difficulty?\nWe have seen earlier that as or ganisms become mor\ne complex, the\nspecialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular\norganisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special\nlineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of\nchromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non-\nreproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division\ncalled meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine\nduring sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in re-\nestablishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in\nthe new generation.\nIf the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has\nhighly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores\nof energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two\ngerm-cells ar e not very dif ferent fr om one another , or may even be similar .\nBut as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also\nspecialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the\nother is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germ-\ncell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored\nfood is called the female gamete. W e shall see in the next few sections\nhow the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to\ndifferences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some\ncases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms.\n7.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\nThe r eproductive parts of angiosper ms ar e located in the flower . You\nhave already studied the different parts of a flower – sepals, petals,\nstamens and pistil. Stamens and pistil are\nthe reproductive parts of a flower which\ncontain the germ-cells.  What possible\nfunctions could the petals and sepals serve?\nThe flower may be unisexual (papaya,\nwatermelon) when it contains either stamens\nor pistil or bisexual ( Hibiscus , mustard)\nwhen it contains both stamens and pistil.\nStamen is the male reproductive part and it\nproduces pollen grains that are yellowish\nin colour . You must have seen this yellowish\npowder that often sticks to our hands if we\ntouch the stamen of a flower . Pistil is pr esent\nin the centre of a flower and is the female\nreproductive part. It is made of three parts.\nFigure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7Figure 7.7\nLongitudinal section of\nflower\n2024-25"

The ovary\ncontains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The male germ-cell\nproduced by pollen grain fuses with the female gamete present in\nthe ovule. This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us the\nzygote which is capable of growing into a new plant.\nThus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the\nstigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower , it is\nreferred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is\ntransferr ed fr om one flower to another , it is known as cr oss-\npollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is\nachieved by agents like wind, water or animals.\nAfter the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the\nfemale germ-cells which are in the ovary. For this, a tube grows\nout of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the\novary.\nAfter fertilisation, the zygote divides several times to form an\nembryo within the ovule. The ovule develops a tough coat and is\ngradually converted into a seed. The ovary grows rapidly and ripens\nto form a fruit.

But in early teenage years,\na whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as\nbody enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes.\nProportions change, new featur es appear , and so do new sensations.\nSome of these changes ar e common to both boys and girls. W e begin\nto notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits\nand the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker\nin colour . Thinner hair can also appear on legs and ar ms, as well as on\nthe face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop\npimples. W e begin to be conscious and awar e of both our own bodies\nand those of others in new ways.\nOn the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are\ndifferent between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase,\nwith darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also,\ngirls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new\nthick hair gr owth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further ,\nthe penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in\ndaydreams or at night.\nAll of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and\nyears. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do\nthey happen at an exact age. In some people, they happen early and\nquickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does\nnot become complete quickly either . So, for example, thick hair on the\nface in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does\nthe growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show\ndifferences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or\nfingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and\nshape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual\nmaturation of the body.\nWhy does the body show sexual maturation at this age? W e have\ntalked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies\nto carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate\nin sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen\nthat plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human\nbeings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However , while the\nbody of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources\nof the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is\nhappening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be\na major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow\ndown, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during\nadolescence is called puberty.\nSo how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the\nreproductive pr ocess? W e must r emember that the sexual mode of\nreproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join\ntogether . This can happen by the exter nal release of ger m-cells fr om the\nbodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants. Or it can happen\nby two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of\ngerm-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to\n2024-25"

Many changes during puberty, such\nas new hair -growth patter ns, ar e signals that sexual maturation is taking\nplace.\nOn the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two\npeople needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it\nis capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is\ncarried in the mother’s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed\nlater. The female r eproductive or gans and br easts will need to matur e to\naccommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in\nthe process of sexual reproduction.\n7.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System\nThe male reproductive system (Fig. 7.10)\nconsists of portions which produce the\ngerm-cells and other portions that deliver\nthe germ-cells to the site of fertilisation.\nThe formation of germ-cells or sperms\ntakes place in the testes. These are located\noutside the abdominal cavity in scrotum\nbecause sperm formation requires a lower\ntemperature than the normal body\ntemperatur e. We have discussed the r ole of the\ntestes in the secretion of the hormone,\ntestoster one, in the pr evious chapter . In\naddition to regulating the formation of sperms,\ntestosterone brings about changes in\nappearance seen in boys at the time of puberty.\nThe sperms formed are delivered\nthrough the vas deferens which unites with\na tube coming fr om the urinary bladder . The\nurethra thus forms a common passage for\nboth the sperms and urine. Along the path\nof the vas deferens, glands like the prostate\nand the seminal vesicles add their secretions\nso that the sperms are now in a fluid which\nmakes their transport easier and this fluid\nalso provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny\nbodies that consist of mainly genetic\nmaterial and a long tail that helps them to\nmove towards the female germ-cell.\n7.3.3 (b) Female Reproductive System\nThe female germ-cells or eggs are made in\nthe ovaries. They are also responsible for the\nproduction of some hormones. Look at\nFig. 7.11 and identify the various organs in\nthe female reproductive system.\nFigure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Figure 7.10 Huma n–male reproductive system\nFigure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Figure 7.11 Huma n–female reproductive system\n2024-25"

                "text": "Science 124When a girl is born, the ovaries already contain thousands of\nimmature eggs. On reaching puberty, some of these start maturing. One\negg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried\nfrom the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube.\nThe two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the\nuterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix.\nThe sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual\nintercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may\nencounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a\nball of cells or embryo. The embryo i s implanted in the li ning of the uterus\nwhere they continue to gr ow and develop or gans to become foetus. W e\nhave seen in earlier sections that the mother’s body is designed to\nundertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself\nevery month to receive and nurture the growing embryo. The lining\nthickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo.\nThe embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a\nspecial tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the\nuterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the\nmother’s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides\na large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to\nthe embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances\nwhich can be removed by transferring them into the mother’s blood\nthrough the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother’s\nbody takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of\nrhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus.\n7.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not F ertilised?\nIf the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary\nreleases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month\nto receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy.\nThis would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had\ntaken place. Now, however , this lining is not needed any longer . So, the\nlining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and\nmucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as\nmenstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days.\n7.3.3 (d) Reproductive Health\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes\nplace while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree\nof sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the\nmind is ready for sexual acts or for having and bringing up children.\nHow do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major\nresponsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures\nabout these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for\nparticipating in many activities, whether we really want to or not. There\ncan be pressure from families to get married and start having children.\nThere can be pressure from government agencies to avoid having\nchildren. In this situation, making choices can become very difficult.\n2024-25"

                "text": "How do Organisms Reproduce? 125We must also consider the possible health consequences of having\nsex. W e have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted\nfrom person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a\nvery intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many\ndiseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections\nsuch as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts\nand HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases\nduring the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis\nduring sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to\nsome extent.\nThe sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy.\nPregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the\nwoman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely\naffected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy.\nThese contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One\ncategory is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not\nreach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the\nvagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts\nby changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not\nreleased and fertilisation cannot occur . These drugs commonly need\nto be taken orally as pills. However , since they change hor monal\nbalances, they can cause side -effects too. Other contraceptive devices\nsuch as the loop or the copper -T are placed in the uterus to pr event\npregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the\nuterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will\nbe prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will\nnot be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take\nplace. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While\nsurgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause\ninfections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can\nalso be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be\nmisused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in\nillegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society,\nthe female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless\nfemale foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in\nsome sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has\nbeen prohibited by law.\nWe have noted earlier that r eproduction is the pr\nocess by which\norganisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a\ngiven population will determine its size. The size of the human population\nis a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding\npopulation makes it harder to improve everybody’s standard of living.\nHowever , if inequality in society is the main r eason for poor standar ds of\nliving for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant.\nIf we look around us, what can we identify as the most important\nreason(s) for poor living standards?\n2024-25"

This means that each trait can\nbe influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. Thus, for each trait\nthere will be two versions in each child. What will, then, the trait seen in\nthe child be? Mendel (see box) worked out the main rules of such\ninheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from\nmore than a century ago.Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2Figure 8.2\n(a) Free and (b) attached\nearlobes.

He took pea plants with different characteristics – a tall plant and\na short plant, produced progeny by crossing them, and calculated the\npercentages of tall or short progeny.\nIn the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this first-\ngeneration, or F1 progeny – no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were\ntall. This meant that only one of the parental traits\nwas seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next\nquestion was, were the tall plants in the F1\ngeneration exactly the same as the tall plants of the\nparent generation? Mendelian experiments test this\nby getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall\nplants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny\nof the par ental plants ar e, of course, all tall. However ,\nthe second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall\nplants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them\nare short. This indicates that both the tallness and\nshortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but\nonly the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel\nto propose that two copies of factor (now called genes)\ncontrolling traits are present in sexually reproducing\norganism. These two may be identical, or may be\ndifferent, depending on the parentage. A pattern of\ninheritance can be worked out with this assumption,\nas shown in Fig. 8.3.Gregor Johann Mendel (1822–1884)\nMendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and\nmathematics at the University of Vienna. Failure in the examinations for a\nteaching certificate did not suppress his zeal for scientific quest. He went\nback to his monastery and started growing peas. Many others had studied\nthe inheritance of traits in peas and other or\nganisms earlier , but Mendel\nblended his knowledge of science and mathematics and was the first one\nto keep count of individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation.\nThis helped him to arrive at the laws of inheritance.\nFigure 8.3Figure 8.3Figure 8.3Figure 8.3Figure 8.3\nInheritance of traits\nover two generations Activity 8.2Activity 8.2Activity 8.2Activity 8.2Activity 8.2\n/square6In Fig. 8.3, what experiment would we do to confirm that the F2\ngeneration did in fact have a 1:2:1 ratio of TT, Tt and tt trait\ncombinations?\nIn this explanation, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only tt is a\nshort plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the\nplant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short.

They are all tall and have\nround seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits.\nBut what happens when these F1 progeny are used to generate\nF2 progeny by self-pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find\nthat some F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds, and some\nwere short plants with wrinkled seeds.  However , ther e would also\nbe some F2 progeny that showed new combinations. Some of them\nwould be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would be short,\nbut have r ound seeds. Y ou can see as to how new combinations of\ntraits are formed in F2 offspring when factors controlling for seed\nshape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form\nF2 offspring (Fig. 8.5). Thus, the tall/short trait and the round\nseed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited.\n8.2.3 How do these T raits get Expressed?\nHow does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is\nthe information source for making proteins in the cell. A section\nof DNA that provides information for one protein is called the\ngene for that protein. How do proteins control the\ncharacteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the\nexample of tallness as a characteristic. W e know that plants\nhave hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus\ndepend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The\namount of the plant hormone made will depend on the\nefficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme\nthat is important for this process. If this enzyme works\nefficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be\ntall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes\nthe enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less,\nand the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics,\nor traits.\nIf the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been\ndiscussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing\nequally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction.\nWe have disscussed this issue in the pr evious Chapter . If both\nparents can help determine the trait in the progeny, both parents\nmust be contributing a copy of the same gene. This means that\neach pea plant must have two sets of all genes, one inherited from\neach parent. For this mechanism to work, each germ cell must\nhave only one gene set.\nHow do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the normal two\ncopies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants inherited a\nsingle whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained\nin Fig. 8.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics ‘R’ and\n‘y’ would then be linked to each other and cannot be independentlyFigure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4Figure 8.4\n2024-25"

                "text": "Science 132inherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not\nas a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,\neach called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each\nchromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-\ncell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either\nmaternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will\nrestore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring\nthe stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance\nexplains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all\nsexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms\nalso follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their\ninheritance might work?\n8.2.4 Se x Deter mination\nWe have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual\nreproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number\nof reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual\ndetermined? Different species use very different strategies\nfor this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,\nin some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at\nwhich fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the\nanimals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In\nother animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex,\nindicating that sex is not genetically deter mined. However ,\nin human beings, the sex of the individual is largely\ngenetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited\nfrom our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls.\nBut so far , we have assumed that similar gene sets ar\ne\ninherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can\ngenetic inheritance determine sex?\nThe explanation lies in the fact that all human\nchromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes\nhave a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22\nsuch pairs. But one pair , called the sex chr omosomes, is\nodd in not always being a per fect pair . Women have a\nperfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men\nhave a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X\nwhile the other is a short one called Y . So women ar e XX,\nwhile men ar e XY. Now, can we work out what the\ninheritance pattern of X and Y will be?\nAs Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and\nhalf will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome\nfrom their mother regardless of whether they are boys or\ngirls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by\nwhat they inherit from their father . A child who inherits\nan X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one\nwho inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6Figure 8.6\nSex determination in\nhuman beings\n2024-25"

On lighting up the room,\nthings become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the\nsunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.\nThis reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.\nWe are able to see thr ough a transpar ent medium as light is transmitted\nthrough it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena\nassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium\nand so on.  A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.\nBy observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may\nconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small\nsource of light casts a sharp  shadow of an opaque object points to this\nstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.More to Know!If an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small , light has a tendency to\nbend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of\nlight. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomena\nsuch as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will study\nin higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known that\nthe wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of\nlight with matter , and light often behaves somewhat like a str eam of  particles . This\nconfusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern\nquantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a ‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ –\nthe new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature.\nIn this Chapter , we shall study the phenomena of r eflection and\nrefraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic\nconcepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in\nnatur e. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the r eflection of light\nby spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real\nlife situations.\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\nA highly polished sur face, such as a mirr or, reflects most of the light\nfalling on it.

The distance of the image from\nthe pole of the mirror is called the image\ndistance ( v). You alr eady know that the\ndistance of the principal focus from the pole\nis called the focal length ( f).

It can be expressed as:\nMagnification ( m)  = ′= −h\nhv\nu(9.3)\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as\nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis.  The height of the\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images.  However , it is to be\ntaken as negative for real images.

This law is also known as Snell’s law of\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i  < 90o)\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\nsin\nsini\nr = constant (9.4)\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\nwith respect to the first.  Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\nYou have alr eady studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely fr om\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1.  In air , the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water . The value of the r efractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11.  Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the\nspeed of light in medium 2.  The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn21. This can be expressed in an equation form as\nn21=Speed of light in medium 1 \nSpeed of light in medium 2=v\nv1\n2(9.5)\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12.

It actually\nmeans  ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\none with the lar ger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other .  The other\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rar er.  The speed of light is higher in a rar er\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\ndenser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from a\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.Note from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density.

Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass\nwith your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle\nor at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker\nare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? W e\nshall discuss these in this section.\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both\nsurfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means\nthat a lens is bound by at least one spherical\nsurface. In such lenses, the other surface would\nbe plane.  A lens may have two spherical\nsurfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\nalso called converging lenses.  Similarly, a double\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\nsurfaces, curved inwards.  It is thicker at the\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\nare also called diverging lenses. A double concave\nlens is simply called a concave lens.\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,\nhas two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces\nforms a part of a sphere.

In fact, the bright spot you got on the\npaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat.  This caused the paper to burn.\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a\nlens.  What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?\nThis is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens\nin Fig.9.12 (b).\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens.\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the\nconcave lens.\nIf you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you\nget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However , a lens has two principal foci.  They\nare represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11.

Y ou also studied the natur\ne, position and relative size of\nimages formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study of\nthe human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects\naround us. It has a lens in its structure.  What is the function of the lens\nin a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of\nvision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter .\nWe have lear nt in the pr evious chapter about light and some of its\nproperties. In this chapter , we shall use these ideas to study some of the\noptical phenomena in natur e. We shall also discuss about rainbow\nformation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.\n10.1 THE HUMAN EYE\nThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.\nIt enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,\ntaste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however , impossible to identify\ncolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human\neye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,\ncolourful world around us.\nThe human eye is like a camera.  Its lens\nsystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eye\nthrough a thin membrane called the cornea.\nIt forms the transparent bulge on the front\nsurface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1.\nThe eyeball is approximately spherical in shape\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the\nrefraction for the light rays entering the eye\noccurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The\ncrystalline lens merely provides the finer\nadjustment of focal length required to focus\nobjects at dif ferent distances on the r etina. W e find a structur e called iris\nbehind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the\nsize of the pupil.  The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light\nFigure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1Figure 10.1\nThe human eye\n2024-25"

The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous\nnumber of light-sensitive cells.  The light-sensitive cells get activated\nupon illumination and generate electrical signals.  These signals are\nsent to the brain via the optic nerves.  The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as\nthey are.\n10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature\ncan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the\nmuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length\nincreases.  This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincr\neases the curvatur e of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker .\nConsequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases.  This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly.\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called\naccommodation.  However , the focal length of the eye lens cannot be\ndecreased below a certain minimum limit.  T ry to r ead a printed page by\nholding it very close to your eyes. Y ou may see the image being blurred\nor feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you\nmust hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes.  The minimum distance, at\nwhich objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the\nleast distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.\nFor a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is\ncalled the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a nor mal eye. Y ou may note\nhere a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and\ninfinity.\nSometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and\ncloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete\nloss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\nSometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.\nIn such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and\ncomfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects\nof the eye.\nThere are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These\nare (i) myopia or near -sightedness, (ii) Hyper metr opia or far -\nsightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia.  These defects can be corrected by\nthe use of suitable spherical lenses.

A person with myopia\ncan see nearby objects clearly but\ncannot see distant objects distinctly.\nA person with this defect has the far\npoint nearer than infinity. Such a\nperson may see clearly upto a\ndistance of a few metres. In a myopic\neye, the image of a distant object is\nformed in front of the retina [Fig.\n10.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself.\nThis defect may arise due to (i)\nexcessive curvature of the eye lens,\nor (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This\ndefect can be corrected by using a\nconcave lens of suitable power . This\nis illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (c). A\nconcave lens of suitable power will\nbring the image back on to the\nretina and thus the defect is corrected.\n(b)Hypermetropia\nHyper metropia is also known as far -sightedness.\nA person with hypermetropia can see distant\nobjects clearly but cannot see nearby objects\ndistinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther\naway from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a\nperson has to keep a reading material much\nbeyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable\nreading. This is because the light rays from a\ncloseby object are focussed at a point behind the\nretina as shown in Fig. 10.3 (b).

Eye-glasses with converging lenses\nprovide the additional focussing power required\nfor forming the image on the retina.\n(c)   Presbyopia\nThe power of accommodation of the eye usually\ndecreases with ageing.

Note the\ncolours that appear at the two ends of the\ncolour band. What is the sequence of colours\nthat you see on the screen? The various\ncolours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,\nYellow, Orange and Red, as shown in\nFig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help\nyou to remember the sequence of colours.\nThe band of the coloured components of a\nlight beam is called its spectrum. Y ou might\nnot be able to see all the colours separately.\nYet something makes each colour distinct fr om the other . The splitting\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion.\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism.\nWhy do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\ncolour emerge along different paths and thus\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum.\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain\nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of\nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar\nprism. However , he could not get any mor e colours. He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This\nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through\nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging\nfrom the other side of the second prism. This observation\ngave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven\ncolours.\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of\nsunlight is often referred to as white light.\nA rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky\nafter a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion\nof sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the\natmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction\nopposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like\nsmall prisms. They refract and disperse the incident\nsunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it\nagain when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due\nto the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different\ncolours reach the observer’s eye.\nYou can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when\nyou look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water\nfountain, with the Sun behind you.Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Figure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\nFigure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Figure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum of\nwhite light\nFigure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Figure 10.7 Rainbow in the sky\nFigure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Figure 10.8 Rainbow formationSunlightRaindrop\n2024-25"

The air just above the fir e becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air . Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen thr ough the hot air , fluctuates.\nThis wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.\nTwinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further , this apparent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers – the\nstar sometimes appears brighter , and at some other time, fainter , which\nis the twinkling effect.\nWhy don’t the planets twinkle? The p lanets are much\ncloser to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.\nIf we consider a planet as a collection of a large number\nof point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the\namount of light entering our eye from all the individual\npoint-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nnullifying the twinkling effect.\nAdvance sunrise and delayed sunset\nThe Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual\nsunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset\nbecause of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we\nmean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.\n10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of the\nSun with respect to the horizon. The time difference\nbetween actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about\n2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at\nsunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon .Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9Figure 10.9\nApparent star position\ndue to atmospheric\nrefraction\n2024-25"

The blue colour of the sky, colour of\nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.\nThe path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.\nHowever , its path becomes visible thr ough a colloidal solution wher e the\nsize of the particles is r elatively lar ger.\n10.6.1 T yndall Effect\nThe earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.\nThese particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles\nof dust and molecules of air . When a beam of light strikes such fine\nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,\nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.\nThus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can\nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest.  Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering\nparticles. V ery fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of\nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.  If the size of the scattering\nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear\nwhite.\n10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8\ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the\natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark.  The sky appears\ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not\nprominent at such heights.\nYou might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights ar e red in colour .\nDo you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke.  Therefore,\nit can be seen in the same colour at a distance.\n2024-25"

It is a controllable\nand convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,\nhospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does\nit flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate\nthe curr ent thr ough an electric cir cuit? In this Chapter , we shall attempt\nto answer such questions. W e shall also discuss the heating ef fect of\nelectric current and its applications.\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\nWe are familiar with air curr ent and water curr ent. W e know that flowing\nwater constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge\nflows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we\nsay that ther e is an electric curr ent in the conductor . In a tor ch, we\nknow that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide\nflow of char ges or an electric curr ent thr ough the tor ch bulb to glow. W e\nhave also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What\ndoes a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and\nthe bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an\nelectric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the\ntorch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.\nHow do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by\nthe amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In\nother words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using\nmetallic wir es, electr ons constitute the flow of char ges. However , electr ons\nwere not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first\nobserved. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive\ncharges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the\ndirection of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the\ndirection of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the\nflow of electrons, which are negative charges.\n2024-25"

The electric\ncurrent is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the\nFrench scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775–1836).

Let us consider the analogy of\nflow of water . Char ges do not flow in a copper wir e by themselves, just as\nwater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube\nis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential differenc e –\nalong the conductor . This dif ference of potential may be pr oduced by a\nbattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in\nmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to\nmaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it.\nWe define the electric potential dif ference between two points in an\nelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other –\nPotential dif fer\nence ( V) between two points = Work done ( W)/Char ge (Q)\nV=W/Q (11.2)\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after\nAlessandr o Volta (174 5–1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the\npotential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor\nwhen 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one\npoint to the other .\nTherefore, 1 volt =  1 joule\n1 coulomb\n(11.3)\n1 V  = 1 J C–1\nThe potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called\nthe voltmeter .

Thus the V–I\ngraph is a straight line that passes through the origin of\nthe graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, \nV/I is a constant\nratio.\nIn 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm\n(1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current\nI, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference\nacross its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the\nends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly\nproportional to the current flowing through it,  provided its\ntemperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In\nother words –\nV ∝ I (11.4)\nor V/I =constant\n=R\nor V =IR (11.5)\nIn Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire\nat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the\nproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges  through it. Its SI\nunit is ohm, r epresented by the Gr eek letter Ω. Accor ding to Ohm’s law,\nR = V/I (11.6)\nIf the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V\nand the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor\nis 1 Ω. That is, 1 ohm = 1 volt\n1 ampere\nAlso from Eq. (11.5) we get\nI = V/R (11.7)\nIt is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is\ninversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the\ncurrent gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase\nor decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to\nregulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable\nresistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to\nchange the resistance in the cir cuit.

The\nchemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between\nits two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current\nthrough a r esistor or a system of r esistors connected to the battery.

A part of\nthe source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into\nuseful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the\nsource energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of\ngadget. W e often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric\nfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of\nresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets\ndissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating\neffect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric\nheater , electric ir on etc.\nConsider a current \nI flowing through a resistor of resistance R . Let\nthe potential difference across it be  V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during\nwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q\nthrough a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply\nenergy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the\nsource is\nP V VI =Q\nt= (11.19)\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t  is P ×\n t,\nthat is, VIt.

In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating\ncan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.\nHowever , heating ef fect of electric curr ent has many useful applications.\nThe electric laundry ir on, electric toaster , electric oven, electric kettle\nand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s\nheating.\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric\nbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically\ninactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of\nthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated.\nAnother common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used  in\nelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with\nthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of\nappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper , iron, lead\netc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic\npurposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron\nwhich consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A\nfuse must be used.QUESTIONS\n?1. Why does the cord of an electric heater not glow while the heating element\ndoes?\n2.

A compass needle is, in fact, a small bar\nmagnet. The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards\nnorth and south directions.

Therefore the iron filings experience a force.  The force\nthus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region\nsurrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected,\nis said to have a magnetic field.

To see this, vary\nthe curr ent in the wir\ne. We find that the deflection in the needle also\nchanges. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases.\nIt indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given\npoint increases as the current through the wire increases.\nWhat happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved\naway from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the\nsame?

What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly\nbelow it and at a point directly above it?\nSolution\nThe current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand\nthumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or\nabove the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,\nwhen viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed\nfrom the west end.Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7Figure 12.7\nRight-hand thumb rule\n*This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule.

Suppose\nthis straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a\ncurrent is passed through it. How would the magnetic field\nlines look like? W e know that the magnetic field pr\noduced\nby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying\ncircular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic\nfield around it would become larger and larger as we move\naway from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would\nappear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\ncurrent would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nstraight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right\nhand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire\ncontributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction\nwithin the loop.Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8Figure 12.8\nMagnetic field lines of the field\nproduced by a current-carrying\ncircular loop?QUESTIONS\n1.

In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other .\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic cir cuits. W e\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.\n1. Name two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and\nappliances.\n2. An electric oven of 2 kW power rating is operated in a domestic electric\ncircuit (220 V) that has a current rating of 5 A. What result do you\nexpect? Explain.\n3. What precaution should be taken to avoid the overloading of domestic\nelectric circuits?\n2024-25"

In this chapter , we shall be studying how various\ncomponents in the environment interact with each other and how we\nimpact the environment.\n13.1 ECO13.1 ECO13.1 ECO\n13.1 ECO13.1 ECO -SYSTEM — WHA-SYSTEM — WHA-SYSTEM — WHA-SYSTEM — WHA-SYSTEM — WHA T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?T ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nAll organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and human\nbeings as well as the physical surroundings interact with each other\nand maintain a balance in nature. All the interacting organisms in an\narea together with the non-living constituents of the environment form\nan ecosystem. Thus, an ecosystem consists of biotic components\ncomprising living organisms and abiotic components comprising\nphysical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil and minerals.\nFor example, if you visit a garden you will find different plants, such\nas grasses, trees; flower bearing plants like rose, jasmine, sunflower;\nand animals like frogs, insects and birds. All these living organisms\ninteract with each other and their growth, reproduction and other\nactivities are affected by the abiotic components of ecosystem. So a garden\nis an ecosystem. Other types of ecosystems are forests, ponds and lakes.\nThese are natural ecosystems while gardens and crop-fields are human-\nmade (artificial) ecosystems.\n/square6You might have seen an aquarium. Let us try to design one.\n/square6What are the things that we need to keep in mind when we create\nan aquarium?

Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar\nand starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the\nSun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria\nwhich can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category\nand are called the producers.\nOrganisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for\ntheir sustenance?

This series or or ganisms taking part at\nvarious biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1).\nEach step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level.\nThe autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level.\nThey fix up the solar energy and make it available for\nheterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary\nconsumers come at the second, small carnivores or the\nsecondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or\nthe tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2).\nWe know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to pr\novide us\nenergy to do work. Thus the interactions among various\ncomponents of the environment involves flow of energy from\none component of the system to another . As we have studied,\nthe autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and\nconvert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the\nactivities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes\nto the heter otrophs and decomposers. However , as we saw in\nthe previous Chapter on ‘Sources of Energy’, when one form\nof ener gy is changed to another , some ener gy is lost to the\nenvironment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow\nof energy between various components of the environment\nhas been extensively studied and it has been found that –\n/square6The green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about\n1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it\ninto food energy.\n/square6When green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal\nof energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes\ninto digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth\nand reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned\ninto its own body and made available for the next level of\nconsumers.\n/square6Therefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount\nof organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next\nlevel of consumers.\n/square6Since so little energy is available for the next level of consumers,\nfood chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss\nof energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy\nremains after four trophic levels.\n/square6There are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower\ntrophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the\nproducers.\n/square6The length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism\nis generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in\nturn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight\nline food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching\nlines called a food web (Fig. 13.3).Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1\nFood chain in nature\n(a) in forest, (b) in\ngrassland and (c) in a\npond\n2024-25"

                "text": "Our Environment 211From the energy flow diagram (Fig. 13.4),\ntwo things become clear . Firstly, the flow of\nenergy is unidirectional. The energy that is\ncaptured by the autotrophs does not revert\nback to the solar input and the energy which\npasses to the herbivores does not come back\nto autotrophs. As it moves progressively\nthrough the various trophic levels it is no\nlonger available to the previous level.\nSecondly, the energy available at each trophic\nlevel gets diminished progressively due to loss\nof energy at each level.\nAnother interesting aspect of food chain\nis how unknowingly some harmful\nchemicals enter our bodies through the food\nchain. Y ou have read in Class IX how water\ngets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of\nseveral pesticides and other chemicals to\nprotect our crops from diseases and pests.\nThese chemicals are either washed down into\nthe soil or into the water bodies. From the\nsoil, these are absorbed by the plants along\nwith water and minerals, and from the water\nbodies these are taken up by aquatic plants\nFigure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystemFigure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3\nFood web, consisting of\nmany food chains\n2024-25"

This is one of the ways in which they enter the food chain.\nAs these chemicals are not degradable, these get accumulated\nprogressively at each trophic level. As human beings occupy the top\nlevel in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicals\nget accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological\nmagnification. This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat\nand rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts\nof pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or\nother means.\nQUESTIONS\n?1. What are trophic levels? Give an example of a food chain and state the\ndifferent trophic levels in it.\n2.

While O2,\nwhich we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of\nlife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However , at the higher levels of the\natmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiation/square6Newspaper reports about pesticide levels in ready-made food items\nare often seen these days and some states have banned these\nproducts.
